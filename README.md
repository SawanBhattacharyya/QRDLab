Quantum random walks quantum analogues of classical random walks. Unlike
the continuous time quantum walk, the discrete time quantum walk algorithm
requires the use of one or more coin qubits representing the number of move-
ment choices from each graph vertex.In Continuous time quantum walk uses a
transition matrix commonly expressed as Hamilton whose evolution over time
is simulated or taken into account. Intuitively, the quantum walk is very sim-
ilar to its classical counter part. In a classical walk, the walker observes some
random process, say a coin toss, and decides on his next step conditioned on
the output of this random process. So for a classical random walk, the walker
is given a probability to make a transition. In a quantum walk, on the other
hand, the random process is replaced by a quantum process,say by a Quantum
Coin,which is a unitary matrix.
So the next step of the walker is controlled by a complex amplitude rather than
a probability. This generalization, from positive numbers to complex numbers,
makes quantum walks more powerful than classical random walks.
